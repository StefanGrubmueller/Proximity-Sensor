# Proximity-Sensor
Configures an sparkfung gesture & proximity sensor (APDS9960) to show the distance of the device to objects
We used a STM32F103RB Cortex M3 Microcontroller on an customized board built by our school (HTBL Hollabrunn, AT)
Datatransfer via I2C; We used a I2C library of a mate so no guarantee but it worked
We also used the armv10_std library to code some standard things and so we also could use bitbanding
